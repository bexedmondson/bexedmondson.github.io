## What I Did

I was part of the client-side development team for this project, mostly responsible for feature implementation and bug fixing. Early on, I did a lot of UI art implementation, and that built up a base for me to do a fair bit of that throughout the project as well. Other notable features I contributed to include the stunt tracking system, our analytics system, and the watch-to-upgrade feature (which was later adapted to several other Hutch titles). I continued to work on the game for all the post-launch updates, after which I moved on to MMX Hill Dash 2](2018-07-01-hill-dash-2.md).
