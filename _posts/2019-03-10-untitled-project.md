## Game Description

This yet-to-be-released, untitled game is a personal project with [Anna Hollinrake](http://www.annahollinrake.com/). It's currently in development without a scheduled release date, but the Github repository is currently public so feel free to have a browse (if I've changed it by the time you see it, reach out to me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bexmakesgames) and I'll get you access!). It's a story-based mobile game about creating tea blends for customers, and we've got big plans!

## What I Did

I made a quick proof of concept to make sure it was a viable project, and now we're developing it into a proper MVP to show to a couple of people. I'm currently building up the basic architecture and game loop, and making debug features as I go. I've done some interesting experiments in architecture, as I've got complete creative control unlike the projects at work: I'm hoping that soon I'll be in a place where I can write some blog posts about the way my state machine works.
