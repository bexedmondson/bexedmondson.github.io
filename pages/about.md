Hi! I'm a client-side developer at Hutch in Shoreditch, and I've been helping make racing games in a small agile team since 2016. I've worked on Hot Wheels: Race Off, which was nominated for four TIGA awards, and I've spent the last few months working on MMX Hill Dash 2. I graduated from the University of Exeter in 2016 with a BSc Computer Science and Maths degree.

In 2018, I was chosen to be one of [GamesIndustry.biz's Top 100 Future Talent](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/top100/2018/b-d), and that year I was also accepted into [BAFTA Crew Games](http://guru.bafta.org/opportunities/crew-games) for the first time. I've also been an ambassador for [Women In Games](http://www.womeningames.org/ambassadors/) for about a year.

Outside of games, I spend most of my free time playing board games or D&D, trying to find all the Korok seeds in Breath of the Wild, scrolling down Twitter, or officiating roller derby!
