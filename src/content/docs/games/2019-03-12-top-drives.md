## My Contributions

I was part of the client-side development team for this 50000+ DAU project as with other Hutch projects, mostly responsible for feature implementation and bug fixing. I also have assisted server-side with bug fixing when necessary. My most notable contribution to date has been working with two other client-side developers to release the Clubs feature, the largest update to Top Drives yet.
