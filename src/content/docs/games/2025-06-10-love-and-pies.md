## Game Description

## My contributions

I was part of the Love and Pies team for six years, from early prototyping and playtesting, via a major pivot in the core game, through global launch, and then into live operations. As a result, it's a little tricky to summarise all the work I did on Love and Pies!

My time as part of the Love and Pies team was truly a formative experience. I came out of it a far better and more experienced developer than I started, and that was largely due to the fantastic team I worked with. I learned a lot from the more senior developers on the team, and as each of them moved on to other projects or teams, I inherited responsibility for the code they'd contributed and extended, refactored and built upon it.

By the time I left the team, I was the longest-standing team member by quite a wide margin and the creator or maintainer of many systems, including but not limited to:
- runtime asset loading logic
- automated addressable asset group creation and population
- over-the-air content delivery
- cutscene implementation tooling
- map progression logic, upgrade handling, and optimisation
- analytics systems, as well as the external automated analytics validation system

I also was the go-to developer for handling complex merges or untangling git mistakes, and often helped other devs work out new system structure or solve complex bugs. My tenure on the project meant I had a thorough understanding of the overall game architecture and could reliably anticipate many issues.

The final project I completed as part of the Love and Pies team was a full refactor of the map asset management logic, which was by far the biggest project I independently delivered. The result of my work was a 60% reduction in build time, 95% reduction in frequently-run bake processes, and a major improvement in visible lag and overall performance.
