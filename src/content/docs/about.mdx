Hi! I’m a client-side generalist game developer in London. I've worked in small teams at Trailmix and Hutch making casual merge-2 and racing games. Most recently, I spent 6 years building the awarding-winning Love and Pies from prototype to production, live ops, and beyond. I've also worked on Top Drives, Hill Dash 2 and Hot Wheels: Race Off. I graduated from the University of Exeter in 2016 with a BSc Computer Science and Maths degree.

On a day-to-day basis, I aim to bring these priorities into whatever I do:
- I'm passionate about making tools that make my teammates' lives easier
- I aim to solve root causes of problems rather than treating symptoms
- I pride myself on being adaptable and on my ability to break into complex problems
- I prioritise comprehension by writing readable code and building a culture that encourages curiosity and exploration

In 2021 I was named as part of Rainbow Jam's Top 100 Queer in Games List, and in 2018 I was chosen to be one of GamesIndustry.biz’s Top 100 Future Talent, and that year I was also accepted into BAFTA Crew Games for the first time. I was also an ambassador for Women In Games for two years.

Outside of making games, I spend most of my free time playing board games or D&D, building yet another base in No Man's Sky, watching deep-dives into things I know nothing about on Youtube, or officiating roller derby!
