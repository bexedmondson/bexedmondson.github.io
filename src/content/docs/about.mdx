Hi! I’m a client-side generalist game developer in London. I've worked in small teams at Trailmix and Hutch making casual merge-2 and racing games. Most recently, I spent 6 years building the awarding-winning Love and Pies from prototype to production, live ops, and beyond. I've also worked on Top Drives, Hill Dash 2 and Hot Wheels: Race Off. I graduated from the University of Exeter in 2016 with a BSc Computer Science and Maths degree.

In 2021 I was named as part of Rainbow Jam's Top 100 Queer in Games List, and in 2018 I was chosen to be one of GamesIndustry.biz’s Top 100 Future Talent, and that year I was also accepted into BAFTA Crew Games for the first time. I was also an ambassador for Women In Games for two years.

Outside of games, I spend most of my free time playing board games or D&D, trying to find all the Korok seeds in Breath of the Wild, watching deep-dives into things I know nothing about on Youtube, or officiating roller derby!
